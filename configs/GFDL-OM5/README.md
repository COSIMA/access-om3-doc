GFDL's OM5 0.25Â° model parameters kindly supplied by Brandon Reichl, 2024-04-13. 

- b00 is similar to OM4-025 but includes a number of bug fixes and algorithm changes.  It is physically consistent with OM4-025 in most regards.
- b03 includes GFDL's latest preferred settings for various parameterizations.

These are from development configurations that GFDL are still analyzing and things will certainly continue to change.
