GFDL's OM5 0.25Â° model parameters kindly supplied by Brandon Reichl, 2024-04-13. 

- `b00` is similar to OM4-025 but includes a number of bug fixes and algorithm changes.  It is physically consistent with OM4-025 in most regards.
- `b03` includes GFDL's latest preferred settings for various parameterizations.
- `b03_update` is latest GFDL OM5 parameter file we have - it's the same as `b_03` apart from a workaround for a MOM6 initialisation bug 

These are from development configurations that GFDL are still analyzing and things will certainly continue to change.
