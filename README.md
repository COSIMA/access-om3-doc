Documentation for COSIMA's [ACCESS-OM3](https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om3) global ocean - sea ice - wave model.

## Quick start
Do this to download the sources for this document:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om3-doc.git
cd access-om3-doc
./setup.sh

You should then be able to generate access-om3-doc.pdf using `latex`. You'll also need to run `bibtex` to get the references and `makeindex` to make the index.
